In my path to learning SQL, i wanted to apply the knowledge with some topics i love but not necessarily in the business field. 
Since i'm a football lover, I [found this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hugomathien/soccer) in Kaggle where somebody recollect a big dataset 
for the top european leagues. It collects data from Teams, Players, and Matches. 

The database was in sqlite, so i worked the analysis on DB Browser for SQLite.

The information shown in the database is a little confused because does not describe what's talk about, so i try to make a small analysis 
selecting some fields i understood. The interesting about the database was that i was able to make some queries with joins, Common Tables Expressions (CTE)
and subqueries.
